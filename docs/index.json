    "title": "Architecture Guide | BbQ.ChatWidgets",
    "summary": "Architecture Guide BbQ.ChatWidgets is designed as a distributed system that coordinates between a .NET backend and a JavaScript-based frontend. This guide explains the core components and the data flow between them. High-Level Overview The system follows a \"Server-Driven UI\" pattern for chat. The LLM decides which widgets are appropriate for the conversation, and the server provides the metadata and templates required for the frontend to render them. Core Components 1. Server-Side (.NET) ChatWidgetService: The central orchestrator. It manages conversation threads, interacts with the IChatClient, parses widget hints from AI responses, dispatches widget actions, and manages context window limits through automatic chat history summarization. WidgetRegistry: A catalog of available widget templates. Each widget (e.g., ButtonWidget, FormWidget) is registered here as a live instance. IThreadService: Manages conversation history and summaries. The default implementation is in-memory (DefaultThreadService), but it can be replaced with a persistent store. IChatHistorySummarizer: Generates concise summaries of older conversation turns to manage context window size. The default implementation uses the AI client. IWidgetActionRegistry: Maps widget actions (e.g., \"submit_form\") to their corresponding server-side handlers. IAIInstructionProvider: Generates the system prompt that tells the LLM how to use widgets and what actions are available. 2. Client-Side (JavaScript/TypeScript) WidgetManager: The primary entry point for rendering widgets. It maintains a registry of component renderers and handles the lifecycle of widgets in the DOM. WidgetSseManager: Handles real-time server-pushed updates for widgets via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Action Dispatcher: Forwards user interactions (like clicking a button or submitting a form) back to the server's /api/chat/action endpoint. Data Flow 1. Message Request The frontend sends a POST request to /api/chat/message with the user's text. ChatWidgetService retrieves the conversation history from IThreadService. If auto-summarization is enabled and the conversation exceeds the threshold, older turns are summarized using IChatHistorySummarizer. It calls the IChatClient (e.g., OpenAI) with the history (including summaries + recent turns) and a system prompt generated by IAIInstructionProvider. The LLM responds, potentially including <widget>...</widget> tags or calling the get_widget_tools function. ChatWidgetService parses these hints, creates the widget metadata, and returns a ChatTurn object containing the text and the list of widgets. 2. Widget Action The user interacts with a widget (e.g., clicks a \"Confirm\" button). The frontend sends a POST request to /api/chat/action with the action name and payload. ChatWidgetService resolves the appropriate handler via IWidgetActionHandlerResolver. The handler executes (e.g., updates a database) and returns a response. The response is appended to the conversation thread, and the updated state is returned to the client. 3. Streaming (SSE) The frontend connects to /api/chat/stream/message. The server streams ChatTurn deltas as they are generated by the LLM. The final event in the stream contains the full ChatTurn with all resolved widgets. Extension Points BbQ.ChatWidgets is highly extensible. You can swap out almost any component by providing your own implementation of the core interfaces: Custom Widgets: Implement IChatWidget and register it in the WidgetRegistry. Custom Persistence: Implement IThreadService to store conversations and summaries in SQL, NoSQL, or Redis. Custom Summarization: Implement IChatHistorySummarizer to use custom logic, templates, or different AI models for summarization. Custom AI Logic: Replace IAIInstructionProvider or IAIToolsProvider to change how the LLM is guided. Context Management The system includes automatic chat history summarization to manage context window limits: Threshold-Based: Automatically triggers when conversation turns exceed a configurable threshold Smart Summarization: Older turns are condensed into summaries while recent turns remain in full detail Configurable: Set thresholds, enable/disable, and customize summarization behavior Extensible: Implement custom IChatHistorySummarizer for domain-specific summarization logic For more details, see the Chat History Summarization Guide."

Prerequisites .NET 8 SDK or later. Node.js 20 or later (for the frontend components). An API key for an AI provider (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI) supported by Microsoft.Extensions.AI. 1. Backend Setup (.NET) Install the Package Add the BbQ.ChatWidgets NuGet package to your ASP.NET Core project: dotnet add package BbQ.ChatWidgets Register Services and Endpoints In your Program.cs, configure the chat client and register the BbQ services. It is crucial to use ChatClientBuilder with .UseFunctionInvocation() to allow the LLM to use the widget tools. using Microsoft.Extensions.AI; using BbQ.ChatWidgets.Extensions; var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); // 1. Configure your underlying AI service IChatClient openaiClient = new OpenAI.Chat.ChatClient( modelId: \"gpt-4o-mini\", apiKey: builder.Configuration[\"OpenAI:ApiKey\"] ).AsIChatClient(); // 2. Wrap it with function invocation support IChatClient chatClient = new ChatClientBuilder(openaiClient) .UseFunctionInvocation() .Build(); // 3. Register BbQ ChatWidgets builder.Services.AddBbQChatWidgets(options => { options.ChatClientFactory = _ => chatClient; }); var app = builder.Build(); // 4. Map the API endpoints (/api/chat/message, /api/chat/action, etc.) app.MapBbQChatEndpoints(); app.Run(); 2. Frontend Setup (JavaScript/TypeScript) Install the Package Install the @bbq-chat/widgets npm package: npm install @bbq-chat/widgets Basic Usage In your frontend application, you can now interact with the backend endpoints. Here is a simple example using fetch: async function sendMessage(text) { const response = await fetch('/api/chat/message', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({ message: text, threadId: \"user-session-123\" // Optional: for conversation history }) }); const turn = await response.json(); console.log(\"AI Response:\", turn.content); console.log(\"Widgets to render:\", turn.widgets); } 3. Rendering Widgets To render the widgets returned by the server, use the WidgetManager from the npm package. import { WidgetManager } from '@bbq-chat/widgets'; // Initialize the manager const manager = new WidgetManager(); // Render widgets into a container const container = document.getElementById('chat-widgets'); turn.widgets.forEach(widget => { manager.render(widget, container); }); Next Steps Architecture Overview: Learn about the internal flow and major components. Widget Catalog: See all available built-in widgets. Custom Widgets: Learn how to build your own interactive components. Action Handlers: Handle user interactions with widgets on the server."

Customize AI instructions options.AIInstructionProviderFactory = sp => new MyCustomInstructionProvider(); }); // Don't forget to register your handlers in DI builder.Services.AddScoped<MyHandler>(); Key Extension Points Explained WidgetRegistryConfigurator This is where you tell the library about your custom widgets. By registering a template instance, the library can automatically generate the tool definition for the LLM, ensuring it knows how to \"call\" your widget. WidgetActionRegistryFactory This is where you map widget actions (sent from the client) to server-side handlers. Using RegisterHandler ensures that the library can correctly deserialize the incoming payload and route it to the right class. RoutePrefix Useful if you need to avoid collisions with other APIs in your application or if you want to version your chat API. AIInstructionProviderFactory Allows you to completely override the system prompt sent to the LLM. This is useful for adding global constraints, changing the \"personality\" of the assistant, or providing additional context about your application's domain."

    "summary": "Chat History Summarization BbQ.ChatWidgets includes automatic chat history summarization to manage context window limits efficiently. This feature helps maintain relevant conversation context while staying within token budget constraints. Overview When conversations grow long, sending the entire history to the AI model can: Exceed token limits Increase API costs Slow down response times Include irrelevant older context The summarization feature automatically condenses older conversation turns into concise summaries while keeping recent turns in full detail. How It Works The system uses a three-part strategy: Threshold Detection: Monitors the number of conversation turns Smart Summarization: Creates summaries of older turns when the threshold is exceeded Context Management: Sends summaries + recent turns to the AI model Architecture Full Conversation History ├── Turns 0-4 → Summarized → \"User discussed X, decided Y\" ├── Turns 5-9 → Summarized → \"Conversation moved to topic Z\" └── Turns 10-11 → Kept in full detail Sent to AI: ├── System Message: Combined summaries └── Recent Turns: Full detail of turns 10-11 Configuration Configure summarization in your AddBbQChatWidgets setup: services.AddBbQChatWidgets(options => { // Enable/disable automatic summarization (default: true) options.EnableAutoSummarization = true; // Trigger summarization after this many turns (default: 15) options.SummarizationThreshold = 15; // Keep this many recent turns in full detail (default: 10) options.RecentTurnsToKeep = 10; // Your chat client options.ChatClientFactory = sp => new OpenAIChatClient(...); }); Configuration Options Option Type Default Description EnableAutoSummarization bool true Enables/disables automatic summarization SummarizationThreshold int 15 Number of turns before summarization kicks in RecentTurnsToKeep int 10 Number of recent turns to keep unsummarized How Summaries Are Generated The DefaultChatHistorySummarizer uses your configured AI client to generate summaries: Formats older conversation turns into a readable format Sends them to the AI with a specialized summarization prompt Receives a concise summary (2-4 sentences) Stores the summary with the thread The summarization prompt instructs the AI to focus on: Main topics discussed Important decisions or conclusions Key information needed for context Action items or pending questions Custom Summarization You can implement custom summarization logic by creating your own IChatHistorySummarizer: public class CustomSummarizer : IChatHistorySummarizer { public async Task<string> SummarizeAsync( IReadOnlyList<ChatTurn> turns, CancellationToken ct = default) { // Your custom summarization logic // Could use: // - A different AI model // - Template-based summarization // - Custom business rules // - Database lookups return \"Custom summary...\"; } } // Register your custom summarizer BEFORE calling AddBbQChatWidgets // This ensures your implementation is used instead of the default services.AddSingleton<IChatHistorySummarizer, CustomSummarizer>(); services.AddBbQChatWidgets(options => { options.ChatClientFactory = sp => new OpenAIChatClient(...); // ... other configuration }); Thread Service Integration The IThreadService interface includes methods for managing summaries: public interface IThreadService { // Existing methods... // Store a summary for a thread void StoreSummary(string threadId, ChatSummary summary); // Retrieve all summaries for a thread IReadOnlyList<ChatSummary> GetSummaries(string threadId); } The DefaultThreadService stores summaries in memory. For production use, implement a persistent IThreadService that stores summaries alongside conversation history. Example: Long Conversation var chatService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ChatWidgetService>(); string? threadId = null; // User has a long conversation (20+ turns) for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) { var response = await chatService.RespondAsync($\"Message {i}\", threadId); threadId = response.ThreadId; } // Check if summaries were created var threadService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IThreadService>(); var summaries = threadService.GetSummaries(threadId); Console.WriteLine($\"Created {summaries.Count} summaries\"); foreach (var summary in summaries) { Console.WriteLine($\"Turns {summary.StartTurnIndex}-{summary.EndTurnIndex}: {summary.SummaryText}\"); } Performance Considerations When to Use Summarization ✅ Good for: Long-running support conversations Multi-session interactions Complex problem-solving discussions Customer service chat histories ❌ Not needed for: Short Q&A exchanges Single-turn requests API-only interactions When using small context windows intentionally Optimization Tips Adjust Thresholds: Set higher thresholds for simpler conversations Cache Summaries: Implement caching in custom IThreadService Use Cheaper Models: Configure a cost-effective model for summarization Batch Processing: Summarize multiple turn ranges at once if needed Testing Summarization The library includes comprehensive tests for summarization: // Unit tests dotnet test --filter \"ChatHistorySummarizationTests\" // Integration tests dotnet test --filter \"SummarizationIntegrationTests\" Example test: [Fact] public async Task AutoSummarization_CreatesAndUsesSummaries() { var services = new ServiceCollection(); services.AddBbQChatWidgets(options => { options.EnableAutoSummarization = true; options.SummarizationThreshold = 5; options.RecentTurnsToKeep = 2; options.ChatClientFactory = _ => new TestChatClient(); }); var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider(); var chatService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ChatWidgetService>(); var threadService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IThreadService>(); // Create conversation beyond threshold string? threadId = null; for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) { threadId = (await chatService.RespondAsync($\"Message {i}\", threadId)).ThreadId; } // Verify summaries were created var summaries = threadService.GetSummaries(threadId); Assert.NotEmpty(summaries); } Best Practices Set Appropriate Thresholds: Balance context preservation with token usage Monitor Summary Quality: Periodically review generated summaries Persist Summaries: Store summaries in production for consistency Consider User Experience: Ensure summaries maintain conversation coherence Test Edge Cases: Verify behavior with very short and very long conversations Troubleshooting Summaries Not Being Created Check: EnableAutoSummarization is true Conversation has exceeded SummarizationThreshold Chat client is properly configured No exceptions in summarization logic Poor Summary Quality Try: Adjusting the summarization prompt in DefaultChatHistorySummarizer Using a more capable AI model for summarization Implementing custom summarization logic Tuning the temperature/parameters for the summarization call Performance Issues Consider: Increasing SummarizationThreshold to summarize less frequently Using a faster/cheaper model for summarization Implementing async summarization in background Caching summaries to avoid regeneration API Reference See the API documentation for detailed reference: IChatHistorySummarizer ChatSummary BbQChatOptions IThreadService Related Topics Architecture Overview Thread Management Getting Started"

  "guides/CUSTOM_ACTION_HANDLERS.html": {
    "href": "guides/CUSTOM_ACTION_HANDLERS.html",
    "title": "Action Handlers Guide | BbQ.ChatWidgets",
    "summary": "Action Handlers Guide Action handlers are the backbone of interactivity in BbQ.ChatWidgets. They allow your server to respond to user interactions with widgets, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or selecting an item from a dropdown. How Actions Work Trigger: A user interacts with a widget in the frontend. Dispatch: The frontend sends a POST request to /api/chat/action containing the action name and a payload. Resolution: The ChatWidgetService uses the IWidgetActionHandlerResolver to find the registered handler for that action. Execution: The handler's HandleAsync method is called with the deserialized payload and the current conversation context. Response: The handler returns a ChatTurn, which is appended to the conversation thread and sent back to the client. Implementing an Action Handler To implement a custom action, you need three components: a payload class, an action class, and a handler class. 1. Define the Payload The payload is a simple DTO that represents the data sent from the client. public class FeedbackPayload { public int Rating { get; set; } public string Comments { get; set; } } 2. Define the Action The action class identifies the action and links it to the payload type. It must implement IWidgetAction<TPayload>. using BbQ.ChatWidgets.Abstractions; public class SubmitFeedbackAction : IWidgetAction<FeedbackPayload> { public string ActionName => \"submit_feedback\"; } 3. Implement the Handler The handler contains the logic to be executed when the action is triggered. It must implement IActionWidgetActionHandler<TAction, TPayload>. using BbQ.ChatWidgets.Abstractions; using BbQ.ChatWidgets.Models; public class FeedbackHandler : IActionWidgetActionHandler<SubmitFeedbackAction, FeedbackPayload> { public async Task<ChatTurn> HandleAsync( SubmitFeedbackAction action, FeedbackPayload payload, ChatRequest context, CancellationToken ct) { // Perform logic (e.g., save to database) Console.WriteLine($\"Received rating {payload.Rating}: {payload.Comments}\"); // Return a response to the user return new ChatTurn( ChatRole.Assistant, \"Thank you for your feedback!\", context.ThreadId ); } } Registering the Handler Register the handler and its metadata in your Program.cs using the WidgetActionRegistryFactory option. builder.Services.AddScoped<FeedbackHandler>(); builder.Services.AddBbQChatWidgets(options => { options.WidgetActionRegistryFactory = (sp, registry, resolver) => { // Register the handler and its metadata registry.RegisterHandler<SubmitFeedbackAction, FeedbackPayload, FeedbackHandler>(resolver); }; }); Using Actions in Widgets When creating a widget, you specify the action name it should trigger. var button = new ButtonWidget(\"Submit Feedback\", \"submit_feedback\"); When the user clicks this button, the frontend will send the submit_feedback action to the server, which will then be routed to your FeedbackHandler. Best Practices Keep Handlers Focused: Each handler should perform one specific task. Return Meaningful Responses: Use the returned ChatTurn to provide feedback to the user or to present the next set of widgets. Use Dependency Injection: Resolve your services (like database contexts) via the handler's constructor."

    "href": "guides/CUSTOM_AI_TOOLS.html",
    "title": "Custom AI Tools Guide | BbQ.ChatWidgets",
    "summary": "Custom AI Tools Guide While BbQ.ChatWidgets automatically provides tools for managing widgets, you may want to expose additional capabilities to the LLM, such as fetching data from an external API or performing complex calculations. This is done by implementing the IAIToolsProvider interface. The IAIToolsProvider Interface The interface has a single method that returns a list of AITool objects. public interface IAIToolsProvider { IEnumerable<AITool> GetTools(); } Implementing a Custom Provider You can use the AIFunctionFactory from Microsoft.Extensions.AI to easily create tools from C# methods. using Microsoft.Extensions.AI; public class MyToolsProvider : IAIToolsProvider { private readonly IWeatherService _weatherService; public MyToolsProvider(IWeatherService weatherService) { _weatherService = weatherService; } public IEnumerable<AITool> GetTools() { // Expose a C# method as an AI tool yield return AIFunctionFactory.Create( (string city) => _weatherService.GetWeather(city), \"get_weather\", \"Gets the current weather for a city\" ); } } Registering the Provider Register your custom provider using the ToolProviderFactory option in AddBbQChatWidgets. builder.Services.AddScoped<IWeatherService, WeatherService>(); builder.Services.AddBbQChatWidgets(options => { options.ToolProviderFactory = sp => new MyToolsProvider(sp.GetRequiredService<IWeatherService>()); }); The Default Provider If you don't provide a custom ToolProviderFactory, the library uses DefaultAIToolsProvider, which includes a retry_tool. This tool is used by the LLM to signal that it needs to retry a previous operation with different parameters. If you want to keep the default tools while adding your own, you can resolve the DefaultAIToolsProvider (if registered) or simply include the retry_tool in your own provider. How the LLM Uses Tools When the ChatWidgetService calls the IChatClient, it includes all tools returned by your provider. The LLM can then choose to call these tools as part of its response generation. The ChatWidgetService handles the execution of these tool calls and feeds the results back to the LLM. Best Practices Provide Clear Descriptions: The LLM relies on the tool and parameter descriptions to understand when and how to use a tool. Keep Tools Idempotent: Ideally, tools should not have side effects that could cause issues if called multiple times (e.g., during a retry). Handle Errors Gracefully: Ensure your tool methods handle exceptions and return meaningful error messages that the LLM can understand."

    "title": "Custom Widgets Guide | BbQ.ChatWidgets",
    "summary": "Custom Widgets Guide Creating custom widgets allows you to extend the chat interface with specialized UI components tailored to your application's needs. This guide covers the end-to-end process of creating and registering a custom widget. 1. Server-Side Implementation (.NET) A widget on the server is a class that implements the IChatWidget interface (or inherits from ChatWidget). It defines the data structure that will be sent to the client and described to the LLM. Create the Widget Class using BbQ.ChatWidgets.Models; public class WeatherWidget : ChatWidget { public string City { get; set; } public double Temperature { get; set; } public string Condition { get; set; } public WeatherWidget(string city, double temp, string condition) : base(\"weather\") // \"weather\" is the unique type identifier { City = city; Temperature = temp; Condition = condition; } } Register the Widget Template You must register an instance of your widget as a \"template\" in the WidgetRegistry. This template is used to generate the tool definition for the LLM. builder.Services.AddBbQChatWidgets(options => { options.WidgetRegistryConfigurator = registry => { // Register a template instance registry.Register(new WeatherWidget(\"London\", 20, \"Sunny\"), \"weather\"); }; }); 2. Client-Side Implementation (JavaScript/TypeScript) On the client, you need to tell the WidgetManager how to render the \"weather\" widget type. Create a Renderer A renderer is a function (or a component in frameworks like React) that takes the widget data and returns a DOM element or JSX. // Vanilla JS Example function renderWeatherWidget(widget, container) { const el = document.createElement('div'); el.className = 'weather-widget'; el.innerHTML = ` <h3>Weather in ${widget.data.city}</h3> <p>${widget.data.temperature}°C - ${widget.data.condition}</p> `; container.appendChild(el); } Register the Renderer import { WidgetManager } from '@bbq-chat/widgets'; const manager = new WidgetManager(); // Register the renderer for the \"weather\" type manager.registerRenderer('weather', renderWeatherWidget); 3. LLM Interaction Once registered, the LLM will automatically see the weather widget as an available tool. It can \"call\" this tool by including a widget hint in its response: <widget type=\"weather\" city=\"Paris\" temperature=\"22\" condition=\"Cloudy\" /> The ChatWidgetService will parse this hint, instantiate your WeatherWidget class, and include it in the ChatTurn sent to the client. Best Practices Keep Data Simple: Only send the data necessary for rendering. Use Descriptive Names: Choose clear type identifiers and property names to help the LLM understand the widget's purpose. Handle Actions: If your widget is interactive (e.g., has buttons), see the Action Handlers Guide to learn how to handle user input on the server."

This provides several benefits: Type Safety: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. Automatic Deserialization: The library handles the conversion from JSON to your C# classes. Better LLM Guidance: The library uses your payload types to generate JSON schemas, which are then provided to the LLM to help it generate valid action payloads. Example: Complex Form Submission Consider a form with multiple fields. You can define a single payload class to represent the entire form state. 1. The Payload public class RegistrationPayload { public string FullName { get; set; } public string Email { get; set; } public string Plan { get; set; } public bool AcceptTerms { get; set; } } 2. The Action public class RegisterUserAction : IWidgetAction<RegistrationPayload> { public string ActionName => \"register_user\"; } 3. The Handler public class RegistrationHandler : IActionWidgetActionHandler<RegisterUserAction, RegistrationPayload> { public async Task<ChatTurn> HandleAsync( RegisterUserAction action, RegistrationPayload payload, ChatRequest context, CancellationToken ct) { // Logic to register the user... return new ChatTurn(ChatRole.Assistant, $\"Welcome, {payload.FullName}!\", context.ThreadId); } } How the LLM Sees This When you register this handler, the DefaultInstructionProvider includes the schema for RegistrationPayload in the system prompt. This tells the LLM exactly what fields are expected when it wants to \"call\" the register_user action. Registration Reminder Don't forget to register both the handler in DI and the action-handler mapping in the WidgetActionRegistry. services.AddScoped<RegistrationHandler>(); services.AddBbQChatWidgets(options => { options.WidgetActionRegistryFactory = (sp, reg, res) => { reg.RegisterHandler<RegisterUserAction, RegistrationPayload, RegistrationHandler>(res); }; }); For more details on the general action handling flow, see the Action Handlers Guide."
