# BbQ.ChatWidgets Documentation

Welcome to the BbQ.ChatWidgets documentation hub. BbQ.ChatWidgets is a powerful, framework-agnostic library designed to bring interactive, rich-media widgets to your AI chat applications.

## What is BbQ.ChatWidgets?

BbQ.ChatWidgets bridges the gap between static AI text responses and interactive user interfaces. It allows LLMs to "render" UI components—like buttons, forms, sliders, and charts—directly within the chat stream, enabling a more engaging and functional user experience.

## Key Features

- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS).
- **.NET 8 Backend**: Seamless integration with ASP.NET Core and `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`.
- **Rich Widget Catalog**: Built-in support for buttons, cards, forms, file uploads, and more.
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time response streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **Triage Agent**: Intelligent request routing and intent classification.
- **Extensible**: Easily create and register your own custom widgets and action handlers.
